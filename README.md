# Terraform AWS S3 Static Website Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform to provision an AWS S3 bucket and deploy a simple static website. The infrastructure is defined as code, allowing for easy reproducibility and scalability.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- **`main.tf`**: Defines the AWS S3 bucket and its configuration.
- **`providers.tf`**: Specifies the required Terraform providers and versions.
- **`variables.tf`**: Contains variable declarations, allowing for customization.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Specifies outputs to be displayed after deployment.
- **`README.md`**: Provides project documentation and usage instructions.
- **`index.html` and `error.html`**: Basic HTML files for the static website.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashant235913/Terraformproject.git
   cd Terraformproject
   ```

2. **Update Variables (Optional):**

   Open `variables.tf` and update the `bucketname` variable if you want to use a different S3 bucket name.

3. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Apply Changes:**

   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

5. **Deploy the Website:**

   Upload your website files (e.g., `index.html`, `error.html`) manually or use a deployment script.

6. **Access the Website:**

   After applying changes, the output will provide the website URL. Visit this URL in your web browser to view your static website.

7. **Cleanup (Optional):**

   If needed, run the following command to destroy the created resources:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy -auto-approve
   ```
